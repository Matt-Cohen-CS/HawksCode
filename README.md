# HawksCode
  HawksCode is a pedagogically focused Java compiler designed with web-based challenges that align with the course objectives of object oriented programming courses at Monmouth University. The challenge bank is designed to accommodate the following courses: Into to Java 1/2, and Data Structures & Algorithms.
  The web-based compiler is designed to provide a series of curriculum based challenged to supplement the existing Computer Science learning experience at Monmouth University. By integrating with the university's existing single sign on system, students are able to track their progress through challenges and receive custom resource recommendations to help meet their personal learning needs.
  The system was developed with Java using the Spring MVC framework. The compiler's user interface to facilitate data transfer between the front-end and back-end. User-input is passed to pre-designed Java files developed to ensure the challenge is complete via the correct method, compiles the student input files, and runs the program if compiled successfully. The system will then log the success on a personal profile page for the student. The site is protected using the Pac4J security library and username/password authenticated with Monmouth University's Federated login server. The student's login credentials are used to track which challenges they have completed successfully.
