/* Declare an integer named a and set the value to 10. Declare an int called counter and set it to 1.
 *  Use a while loop to increment counter 5 times while the condition is true. Once the condition is false, 
 *  use a break statement to �break� out of the loop. Then return the concatenated phrase ��Sum is �+ variable�� 
 *  so that all 5 sum totals will print in sequential order.

HINT: the break statement should be nested within the while loop in an if statement.
