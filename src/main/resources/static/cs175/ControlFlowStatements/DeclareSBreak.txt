/* Similar to the DeclareSwitch example, write a program using switch statements
 * that assigns the day of the week based on which number is assigned to the variable day. 
 * Use int day for number 1-7, set it equal to 7 for testing purposes. Use String dayName for 
 * each day of week, initialize it to ��. This time, put break statements in between. 
 * Also, write the statement default: dayName=�Invalid Day�; Break; This will be a catch
 * all for any number not between 1 and 7.

HINT: You will need to make separate �cases� for every day of the week. You will have 
cases 1-7. Make Sunday #1, Monday #2 and so on. Notice what will print when you write 
the print statement for dayName. Notice now what happens when including the break 
statements. Compare it to what happened with the DeclareSwitch problem. Do you recall 
what the output gave you?
