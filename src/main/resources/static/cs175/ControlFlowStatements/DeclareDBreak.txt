/* Declare integers a, b, sum, newSum, and counter. Set a=2, set b=5. Write a Do loop
 that is set to add integers a and b while counter is < -5000. Within the do 
 section assign sum the value of sum+a+b. Next, set newSum to the value of sum, 
 then write an if-statement that checks if sum == 7 {break;}. Finally, within 
 the do set sum = sum + 1000. After the do-while, print out Sum and newSum. 
 What do you think the values of sum and newSum will be? Do you think they�ll
  be the same or different?

HINT: Do-While loops are designed to run at least once regardless of the
 condition set in the While part of the loop. Whatever you write within the 
 Do statement will run once. A Break statement uses the keyword break in Java. 
 In this statement, java will �break� you out of any loop and go to the next 
 statement.
